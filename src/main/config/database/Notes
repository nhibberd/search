Now, in the VersionOne case, add 1 extra statement which inserts '1' into the SCHEMA_VERSION table
Now you can run up safely.
Ok, you then need to make a db change.
To make a change you create a class PatchOneToTwo
In this you would put, what ever create table/alter table statements you need to update your database assuming the existance of a version 1 db
and of course 1 extra statement that replaces the SCHEMA_VERSION row with the value 2.
At this point you will need to change your startup code.
You would:
1. If no DB exists, create it using VersionOne, then upgrade it with PatchOneToTwo.
2. If DB exists, and SCHEMA_VERSION = 1, then upgrade it with PatchOneToTwo
3. If DB exists, and SCHEMA_VERSION = 2, then do nothing
